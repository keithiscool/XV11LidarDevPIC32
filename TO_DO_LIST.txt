1)	Work with TFT touch screen display to visualize what the x,y data from the pic32 is like
2)	Attempt to utilize the derivative between points on x,y plot.
	This will show us if a corner is detected
	This will also help identify the object due to its size
3)	Utilize the warning flags
	The "flag data" can be used to identify whether the object that is being looked at is the correct shade and allows
	the amount of reflected light to verify the object(s) being tracked.
