MY RESPONSE BEGINS HERE:
I am definitely using your arduino shield board (it says www.buydisplay.com on it) shield (P/N: ER-AS-SSD1963 V1.0) 
link: http://www.buydisplay.com/default/arduino-shield-for-tft-lcd-with-ssd1963-controller-compatible-with-mega-due

The back light part of this display is defective. In the videos I shared with you, it shows the ribbon cable that 
connects between the TFT display and your custom board mounted to the back of the display. If I touch the cable,
the backlight turns on and off.

The TFT (ER-TFTM070-4V2.1-CTP) that you sent me has a faulty ribbon cable and is not working. 
The screen does not work due to a hardware issue with the ribbon cable.
The video of the faulty ribbon cable turning the display on and off is viewable in the link I sent you:

I would like my money back.

Thank you,
Keith
